# Convergent-SST

Sparse methods for convergent planning

all source codes are in src
the main files are Convergent_SST.m and B_RRT.m(biased convergent planning without using sparse methods)

previous simulation results are in Data folder
evaluate_res.m can be used to visualize simulation results

the dynamical system for hill climbing simulation is described is HillClimbingSys.pdf
