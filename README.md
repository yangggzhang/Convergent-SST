# Convergent-SST

Sparse methods for convergent planning

All source codes are in src
The main files are Convergent_SST.m and B_RRT.m(biased convergent planning without using sparse methods)

Previous simulation results are in Data folder
Evaluate_res.m can be used to visualize simulation results

The dynamical system for hill climbing simulation is described is HillClimbingSys.pdf

The implementation of convergent-sst and biased-rrt in c++ can be found in c_sst_in_cpp.
